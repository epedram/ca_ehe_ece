# GridEX: A Grid-based Dataset of Area-wide Extreme Heat and Cold Events (AWEHE/AWECE)

GridEX provides a grid-based measure of exposure to extreme heat and cold events. It leverages a data science pipeline to gather station-based climatological data and estimate fine-resolution surfaces of ambient (i.e., temperature of air at 2m above the land surface) and apparent temperature (i.e., the perceived temperature by humans which takes into account humidity and wind in addition to the actual air temperature) with 500x500 meter resolution.

This repository provides a suit of R scripts that help to replicating our data science pipeline and generating the dataset.
